## 🔄 Integration Points

### Contract Creation Flow
```typescript
// 1. User selects payment method
<PaymentMethodSelector
  projectValue={800000}
  selectedMethod={paymentMethod}
  onMethodChange={setPaymentMethod}
/>

// 2. User enters promo code (optional)
<PromoCodeInput
  projectValue={800000}
  paymentMethod={paymentMethod}
  userId={user.id}
  onPromoApplied={(data) => setPromoData(data)}
/>

// 3. Calculate final commission
const commission = await calculateCommissionWithPromo(
  projectValue,
  paymentMethod,
  promoCode,
  userId,
  eventType
);

// 4. Create contract with commission details
await createContract({
  ...contractData,
  payment_method: paymentMethod,
  promo_code_used: promoCode,
  promo_discount_applied: commission.promoDiscount,
  final_commission_amount: commission.finalCommission,
  gst_amount: commission.gstAmount
});
```

### Cash Payment Confirmation
```typescript
// Client confirms
await confirmCashPayment({
  contractId,
  confirmedBy: 'client',
  confirmationNotes: 'Paid in cash on 2025-01-31'
});

// Vendor confirms
await confirmCashPayment({
  contractId,
  confirmedBy: 'vendor',
  confirmationNotes: 'Received full payment'
});

// Auto-generates invoice when both confirm
```

### Commission Invoice Generation
```typescript
// Automatically triggered when both parties confirm
const { invoice } = await generateCommissionInvoice(
  contractId,
  commissionData
);

// Invoice details:
// - Number: EF-202501-0001
// - Due Date: 15 days from today
// - Amount: Commission + GST + Platform Fee
```
