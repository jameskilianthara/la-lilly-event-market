## Architecture Patterns

### Data Flow
1. **User Input** â†’ ChatBuilder/Forms
2. **localStorage** â†’ emx:* contracts
3. **Write-Behind** â†’ Supabase (when enabled)
4. **Export** â†’ CSV/JSON for external use

### Component Structure
- **Pages**: Route-based components in `src/app/`
- **Components**: Reusable UI in `src/components/`
- **Hooks**: Business logic in `src/hooks/`
- **Libraries**: Utilities in `src/lib/`
- **Types**: TypeScript definitions in `src/types/`

### State Management
- **localStorage**: Primary data store
- **React State**: UI state and form data
- **Context**: Theme, auth, and global state
- **Supabase**: Remote data sync (optional)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **ESLint**: Airbnb config with custom rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Smoke Tests**: Route health checks
- **Component Tests**: React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Feature workflows
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys

### Performance Requirements
- **Lighthouse Score**: 90+ on all metrics
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial load
- **Time to Interactive**: <3 seconds
- **Core Web Vitals**: All green

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Data Loss**: Regular backups + DB sync
2. **Performance**: Bundle analysis + lazy loading
3. **Security**: Feature flags + input validation
4. **Scalability**: Database optimization + caching

### Business Risks
1. **Vendor Quality**: Rating system + verification
2. **Payment Issues**: Multiple providers + fallbacks
3. **Legal Compliance**: Contract templates + legal review
4. **User Experience**: A/B testing + feedback loops

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Current)
